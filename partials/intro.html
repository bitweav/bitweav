    <p>BitWeav is the first open micropublishing network that is built entirely by those who use it.</p>
    <p>It's a peer-to-peer network of people (think BitTorrent) that work together using the BitWeav software to distribute updates to eachother on topics (profiles, hashtags, threads), in contrast to existing systems which host and control the entirety of their ecosystems.</p>
    <p>Think of BitWeav as the indie alternative to Twitter, with features like:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><p><strong>Freedom</strong> — There is no censorship and there are no restrictions imposed on you, as the network is not controlled by anyone.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Privacy</strong> — You maintain control over your own data, and no personal details are needed to get started. There is no advertising either.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Hashtags</strong> — You can use hashtags to categorise messages, and you can follow any number of topics.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Multilingual support</strong> — Unlike others, BitWeav supports the exchange of messages in various languages and scripts.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Strong legality</strong> — You are assured that you only participate in distributing messages on topics you're interested in, unlike other P2P networks which make you support the entire network.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Open and free</strong> — You can rely on the functionality and security of BitWeav because its and open design and an open-source implementation. Anyone can improve the software, and even build their own apps on top of it.</p></li>
    </ul>
